# Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using IntelliJ IDEA Community, Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium , Cucumber and Page Object Model (POM)

# Setup Project 
Easy way-
1) Create a empty repository on github
2) Use git clone to clone the repository on local
3) Create a maven project locally and copy its content to this newly cloned empty repository.
4) Navigate to cloned repository
5) Thats it and you can use git commands pull and push

Proper way
1) Open github and create a new repository with same name as local repo that we are going to create in below steps.
2) Open eclipse and create a new Maven project
3) open gitbash and type below commands
4) git init to initialize or convert existing project to git repo
5) git add . to add all files to staging area
6) git commit -m "message"
7) git remote add origin https://github.com/aditya2001/selenium-java-cucumber
8) git push -u -f origin master
The -f switch forces Git to overwrite any files that already exist on GitHub with your existing projectâ€™s files.
