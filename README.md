# Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using IntelliJ IDEA Community, Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium , Cucumber and Page Object Model (POM)

# Features of the framework--

# Parallel Testing and Parameterization-  
 testng.xml is a configuration file for organizing and executing test.We can provide different test suites and specify test classes to execute for parallel testing
 This significantly reduces execution time, improving overall efficiency and productivity in testing.
 testng.xml allows to run same test with different input data. Ex we can pass different browser and env values as parameters.

# Organization- 
We can organize test into different logical groups.Like can create different suites for running test on different browser.

# Integration with Jenkins- 
testng.xml integrates easily with build tools like Maven and Jenkins. 
We use maven sure fire plugin which executes testng.xml which ultimately executes runner file mentioned insides class in testng.xml.


# Setup Project 
Easy way-
1) Create a empty repository on github
2) Use git clone to clone the repository on local
3) Create a maven project locally and copy its content to this newly cloned empty repository.
4) Navigate to cloned repository
5) That's it, and you can use git commands pull and push

Proper way
1) Open GitHub and create a new repository with same name as local repo that we are going to create in below steps.
2) Open eclipse and create a new Maven project
3) open git bash and type below commands
4) git init to initialize or convert existing project to git repo
5) git add . to add all files to staging area
6) git commit -m "message"
7) git remote add origin https://github.com/aditya2001/selenium-java-cucumber
8) git push -u -f origin master
The -f switch forces Git to overwrite any files that already exist on GitHub with your existing projectâ€™s files.
